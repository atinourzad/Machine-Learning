In this project, we were to classify sick and healthy people based on the given dataset. To do so, various methods of preprocessing and classification are employed. The performance of each combo is then evaluated with different metrics to get insight which is the best one for the given task. Below, a list of preprocessing, classification, and metric methods utilized in this project are stated. 

### Preprocessing

  * Min Max Scaler
  * Standard Scaler
* Balancing
  * Random Undersampling and Oversampling
  * Undersampling and Oversampling
* Dimension Reduction
  * Filter Methods
    * PCA
    * ICA
    * Autoencoders
   * Wrapper Methods
     * LDA

### Classification
* Generative Approaches
  * Parzen Window with Bayesian Classifier
